* The meeting lasted 2 hours.

# MEETING 2 - October 27 2018

* The Sign In button was programmed to validate a basic input username = admin and password = admin, as a prototype.
* The Sign In button was programmed to take the user to the next activity, Game Launcher Activity.
* The Sign In button and Sign Up buttons were not completely programmed.
* The meeting lasted 2 hours, approx.

# MEETING 3 - October 29 2018
* The login functionality was completely finished.
* No individual or pair assignment was designated, since several design decisions were still pending, for which the entire group is required.
* Further details about the game launcher activity were discussed.
* The meeting lasted 1 hour in the lab and 3 hours afterwards.

# MEETING 4 - November 3 2018
* The work was split into a group of two and a group of three.
* One group worked on and finished the saving and loading functionality.
* The other group worked on and finished the adding of the undo button.
* The meeting lasted 4 hours, approx.

# MEETING 5 - November 4 2018
* The work was split into groups again.
* One group worked on and finished the scoreboard functionality, including saving to file and the scoreboard activity.
* The other group worked on and finished the undo functionality and the complexity functionality, partially.
* The meeting lasted 7 hours approx.

# MEETING 6 - November 5 2018
* Some errors with the Scoreboard functionality were fixed.
* The auto save functionality was finished.
* The work done on different local stations were merged, and conflict was resolved, to create a final working app, with all functionality.

# Phase 2

# MEETING 7 - November 17 2018 
* The two extra games that need to be implemented were discussed. 
* The team was split into two groups.
* The groups discussed about which games needed to be made. 
* The first group decided to work on Minesweeper, since we can reuse the grid implementation. 
* The second group decided to work on a level-based memory game called Matching Tiles, which also uses the grid implementation.
* The groups presented their plans for the implementations of the games and the reason they chose the games. 
* An action plan was created with a CRC design for each game. Everyone worked alone on certain classes before the next meeting. 

# MEETING 8 - November 25 2018
* The groups have finished the games at home. 
* During this meeting, the programming was properly compiled and tested. 
* Notes were taken on the improvements that needed to made to the games. 
* The scoreboard implementation needed to be improved, so we discussed potential design ideas
and decided on creating two distinct scoreboard objects (one for users, one for the game centre) and using maps to map games to scores. 
* The testing for each game was discussed and the coverage was discussed. 
* The work for the test files were split to be done individually by the group members. 

# MEETING 9 - November 29 2018 
* The test files were completed individually. 
* During this meeting, the code coverage of the test files was optimized. 
* The scoreboard functionality was reworked on as a group. 
* The new scoreboard functionality was finished and debugged. 
* Refactoring for code smells was done.
* Final checks and push for submission.
